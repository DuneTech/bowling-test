Bowling Challenge
=================

## The Task

**THIS IS NOT A BOWLING GAME, IT IS A BOWLING SCORECARD.**

Create an application to calculate the scores of a bowling game (in JavaScript). 

A bowling game consists of 10 frames in which the player tries to knock down the 10 pins. In every frame the player can roll one or two times. The actual number depends on strikes and spares. The score of a frame is the number of knocked down pins plus bonuses for strikes and spares. After every frame the 10 pins are reset.

The application should allow the user to enter a score, frame-by-frame, and display the latest score.

### Getting started

Start by looking in detail at the rules and scoring, see some example resources below:

- [https://www.wikihow.com/Score-Bowling](https://www.wikihow.com/Score-Bowling)
- [https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling#Ten-pin](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling#Ten-pin)

Please start by forking this repository. You may find this task easiest if you use Test-Driven Development (TDD) for the scoring logic, but please at least include _some_ tests, and a README specifying how to run and use your solution.

___STRONG HINT, IGNORE AT YOUR PERIL:___ Bowling is a deceptively complex game. Careful thought and potentially diagramming — both before and throughout — may save you a lot of time.

### Optional Extras

In any order you like:

* Set up a CI solution to run your tests.
* Add [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) to your codebase and make your code conform.
* Deploy your solution somewhere (eg. Heroku)

## Code Review

In code review we'll be hoping to see:

* All tests passing
* The code is elegant: every class has a clear responsibility, methods are short etc.
